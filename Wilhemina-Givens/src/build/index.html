        This is the home page of my tribute to my grandmother Wilhelmina, lovingly called Mina.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-yellow-900 mb-4 font-serif text-lg">
        Wilhelmina was born in 1941 in a small town in the Gulf region of Louisiana.<br>
        She lived through significant historical events, including World War II, and was known for her resilience and kindness.<br>
        She had a passion for gardening and cooking, often sharing her delicious recipes with family and friends.<br>
        Wilhelmina's legacy lives on through her children and grandchildren, who cherish the memories and values she instilled in them.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center text-yellow-900 font-serif text-lg">
        She passed away in December of 2009, but her spirit continues to inspire those who knew her.<br>
        This tribute page is dedicated to celebrating her life and the impact she had on her loved ones.

        My grandmother was a kind soul who loved fishing, boating, and spending time with her grand and great-grandkids.<br />
        She was a devoted Christian, always willing to help anyone in need.<br />
        A great cook, baker, and talented seamstress, she made many of her own clothes.<br />
        Wilhelmina was strong, independent, and raised her family with love and care.<br />
        She taught the importance of family, faith, and hard work.<br />
        Her memory lives on in the hearts of those who knew and loved her.
